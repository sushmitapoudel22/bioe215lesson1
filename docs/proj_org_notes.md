# Start with creating a new R project for your data analysis
Make sure you save it somewhere you know on your computer.make sure you check the git repository
I already have the git tab on my R studio and do not have to do that again until I replace my computer

Create all the folders needed for your project to keep them organized
First, activate Pages on GitHub. go to your GitHub repo in your browser. Click on Settings and choose Pages under Code and automation. Under Source it should say Deploy from a branch. Under Branch, change None to main and the directory from / (root) to /docs. Click Save.

Now you need to give GitHub something to deploy. Go back to RStudio and commit all your new and changed files. To do this, go to the Git pane. You’ll see a list of new and modified files. Check the boxes next to all of them to stage the files. This tells git you’d like to commit them. Click on the Commit button to launch the Review Changes dialog and add a commit message. As a rule of thumb, keep commit messages short (<50 characters). Click the Commit button, then click the Push button.
